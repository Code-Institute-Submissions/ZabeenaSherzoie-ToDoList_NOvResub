### Future Features:
- The feature to add the exact due time for a task.
## Testing:
The media queries were very challenging. It took a lot of trial & error in the Chrome Dev tool to adjust everything accordingly so that it would not display horribly when the page was to be resized.
I faced problem figuring out the right rules for the form  responsivity issue specialy for less than 500px wide screens. And it seems to still have problem.
I got stuck on how to change the place of input element and select element when the screen gets smaller,then I figured out to use two form elements.
